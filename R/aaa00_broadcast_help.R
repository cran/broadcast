#' Broadcasted Array Operations Like 'NumPy' \cr \cr
#' 
#' 
#' ```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
#' 
#' txt <- packageDescription("broadcast", fields = "Description")
#' p <- c("\t", ",\n", ".\n", "\n(", "following.")
#' rp <- c("", ", ", ".\n\n",  " (", "following:")
#' for(i in 1:length(rp)) {
#'  txt <- gsub(p[i], rp[i], txt, fixed = TRUE)
#' }
#' txt <- paste0(txt, "\\cr \\cr")
#' cat(txt)
#' ```
#' 
#' In the context of operations involving 2 (or more) arrays,
#' “broadcasting” refers to recycling array dimensions without allocating additional memory,
#' which is considerably faster and more memory-efficient
#' than R’s regular dimensions replication mechanism. \cr \cr

#' @section Functions:
#' 
#' \bold{Broadcasted Operators} \cr
#' Base 'R' comes with relational (==, !=, etc.),
#' arithmetic (+, -, *, /, etc.), and logical/bit-wise (&, |) operators. \cr
#' 'broadcast' provides 2 ways to use these operators with broadcasting. \cr
#' \cr
#' The first (and simple) way is to use the \link{broadcaster} class,
#' which comes with it's own method dispatch for the above mentioned operators. \cr
#' This method support operator precedence, and for the average 'R' user,
#' this is sufficient. \cr
#' \cr
#' The second way is to use the large set of `bc.`- functions. \cr
#' These offer much greater control and more operators than the previous method,
#' and has less risk of running into conflicting methods. \cr
#' But it does not support operator precedence. \cr
#' \cr
#' More information about both methods can be found here: \cr
#' \link{broadcast_operators}. \cr
#' \cr
#' 
#' 
#' \bold{Binding Arrays} \cr
#' 'broadcast' provides the \link{bind_array} function,
#' to bind arrays along an arbitrary dimension,
#' with support for broadcasting. \cr
#' \cr
#' The API of `bind_array()` is inspired by the fantastic
#' \code{abind::abind()} function
#' by Tony Plare & Richard Heiberger (2016). \cr
#' But `bind_array()` differs considerably from \code{abind::abind}
#' in the following ways:
#'  
#'  - `bind_array()` allows for broadcasting,
#'  while \code{abind::abind} does not support broadcasting.
#'   - `bind_array()` is generally faster and more memory-efficient than \code{abind::abind},
#'  as `bind_array()` relies heavily on 'C' and 'C++' code.
#'  - `bind_array()` differs from \code{abind::abind}
#'  in that it can handle recursive arrays properly \cr
#'  (the \code{abind::abind} function would unlist everything to atomic arrays,
#'  ruining the structure).
#'  - unlike \code{abind::abind},
#'  `bind_array()` only binds (atomic/recursive) arrays and matrices. \cr
#'  `bind_array()`does not attempt to convert things to arrays when they are not arrays,
#'  but will give an error instead. \cr
#'  This saves computation time and prevents unexpected results.
#'  - `bind_array()` has more streamlined naming options,
#'  compared to \code{abind::abind}. \cr
#' 
#' See \link{bind_array}. \cr\cr
#' 
#'  
#' \bold{Casting Functions} \cr
#' 'broadcast' provides several "casting" functions. \cr
#' These can facility complex forms of broadcasting that would normally not be possible. \cr
#' But these "casting" functions also have their own merit, beside empowering complex broadcasting. \cr
#' \cr
#' More information about the casting functions can be found here: \cr
#' \link{broadcast_casting}. \cr
#' \cr
#' 
#' \bold{General Pairwise Broadcasted Functions} \cr
#' 'broadcast' also comes with 2 general pairwise broadcasted functions:
#' 
#'  * \link{bc_ifelse}: Broadcasted version of \link[base]{ifelse}.
#'  * \link{bcapply}: Broadcasted apply-like function. \cr \cr
#' 
#' 
#' \bold{Other functions} \cr
#' 'broadcast' provides
#' \link[=as_bool]{type-casting} functions,
#' which preserve names and dimensions - convenient for arrays. \cr
#' \cr
#' 'broadcast' also provides
#' \link[=sd_lc]{simple linear algebra functions for statistics}. \cr
#' \cr
#' And 'broadcast' comes with some helper functions: \cr
#' \link{bc_dim}, \link{ndim}, \link{lst.ndim}, \link{rep_dim}. \cr \cr
#' 
#' 
#' @section Supported Structures:
#' 'broadcast' supports atomic/recursive arrays (up to 16 dimensions),
#' and atomic/recursive vectors. \cr
#' As in standard Linear Algebra Convention,
#' dimensionless vectors are interpreted as column-vectors in broadcasted array operations. \cr
